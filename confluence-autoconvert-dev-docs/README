Confluence Plugin example : Extending Autoconvert
https://developer.atlassian.com/confdev/tutorials/extending-autoconvert

- Confluence 5.9.9 (latest version on May-10-2016)
- Atlassian Plugin SDK 6.2.6

[note]
This plugin converts URL only Pasted (Ctrl+V or etc). Do not input URL with "h t t p s...." by keyboard.

URL to be converted must be
    https://developer.atlassian.com/confdev/.../.......
because of real URL of Confluence documents on developer.atlassian.com (they are not https://developer.atlassian.com/display/CONFDEV/....)
